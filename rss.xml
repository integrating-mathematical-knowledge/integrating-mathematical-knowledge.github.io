<h5>As said in the book &quot;Truth Through Proof A Formalist Foundation for Mathematics&quot; by Alan:</h5>

<h5>The platonistic conception of mathematics as providing knowledge of the immutable also has, for some,  <em>a quasi-religious attraction</em>.</h5>

<h5>Betrand Russel wrote of the consolation mathematics seemed to offer him, when beset with the woes of our ephemeral and careworn world. Mathematics, wrote Russel, is [r]emote from human passions, remote even from the pitful facts of nature and a realm where <em>pure thought</em> can dwell as in its nature home, where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can scape from the dreary exile of the actual world.</h5>

<h5>&quot;...the greatest thing is purely mathematical thinking: this is worth much more than the application of mathematics.&quot;</h5>
